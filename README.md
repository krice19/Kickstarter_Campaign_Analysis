Another analysis was looking into the goal amounts of successful kickstarters.  Here, we specifcally looked into musicals in Great Britian.  The average goal was about $4K, however, this is outside the 3rd quartile of the actually amount raised.  We can assume that you should lower the goal amount if looking to raise a musical kickstarter in Great Britian,
